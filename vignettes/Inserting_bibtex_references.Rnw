Package \pkg{Rdpack} provides a straightforward way to insert BibTeX references in the
documentation of an R package, using the RdMacros feature introduced in R~3.2.0. It
works for `roxygen2' documentation, as well.

\section{Setup}
\label{sec:org288fce5}

To prepare a package for importing BibTeX references it is necessary to tell the
package management tools that package \pkg{Rdpack} and its Rd macros are
needed. The references should be put in file \texttt{inst/REFERENCES.bib}.
These steps are enumerated below in somewhat more detail for convenince:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add the following lines to  file `DESCRIPTION':
\begin{verbatim}
   Imports: Rdpack
   RdMacros: Rdpack
\end{verbatim}
Make sure the capitalisation of \texttt{RdMacros} is as shown. If the field 'RdMacros' is already
present, add `Rdpack' to the list on that line. Similarly for field 'Imports'.

\item Add the following line to file `NAMESPACE'\footnote{Any function for package \pkg{Rdpack} will do. This is to avoid getting a
warning from 'R CMD check'.}:
\begin{verbatim}
   importFrom(Rdpack,reprompt)
\end{verbatim}
The equivalent line for `roxygen2' is
\begin{verbatim}
   #' @importFrom Rdpack reprompt
\end{verbatim}

\item Create file \texttt{REFERENCES.bib} in subdirectory \texttt{inst/} of your package and put
the bibtex references in it.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Inserting references in package documentation}
\label{sec:orgb2db2dc}

Once the steps outlined in the previous section are done, references can be
inserted in the documentation as \texttt{\textbackslash{}insertRef\{key\}\{package\}},
where \texttt{key} is the bibtex key of the reference and \texttt{package} is your package.
This works in Rd files and in roxygen documentation chunks.

In fact, argument 'package' can be any installed R package\footnote{There is of course the risk that the referenced entry may be removed from
the other package. So this is probably only useful for one's own
packages. Also, the other package would better be one of the packages
mentioned in DESCRIPTION.\}},
not necessarily the current
one. This means that you don't need to copy references from other packages to your
\texttt{"REFERENCES.bib"} file.  This works for packages that have \texttt{"REFERENCES.bib"} in
their installation directory and for the default packages.
See also the help pages \texttt{?Rdpack::insertRef} and \texttt{?Rdpack::Rdpack-package}.  For
example, the help page \texttt{?Rdpack::insertRef} contains the following lines in section
``References'' of the Rd file:
\begin{verbatim}
    \insertRef{Rpack:bibtex}{Rdpack}
    \insertRef{R}{bibtex}
\end{verbatim}
The first line above inserts the reference labeled \texttt{Rpack:bibtex} in Rdpack's
\texttt{REFERENCES.bib}. The second line inserts the reference labeled \texttt{R} in file
\texttt{REFERENCES.bib} in package `bibtex'.

A roxygen2 documentation chunk might look like this:
\begin{verbatim}
    #' @references
    #' \insertRef{Rpack:bibtex}{Rdpack}
    #'
    #' \insertRef{R}{bibtex}
\end{verbatim}



\section{Inserting citations}
\label{sec:orgb12f392}

From version 0.7 of \pkg{Rdpack}, additional Rd macros are available for
citations\footnote{They were introduced in the development version 0.6-1, but 0.7
is the first version with them released on CRAN.}.  They can be used in both Rd and roxygen2 documentation.  If you are
using these, it will be prudent to require at least this version of Rdpack in
the ``Imports:'' directive in file DESCRIPTION: \texttt{Rdpack (>= 0.7)}.

\subsection{Macros fof citations}
\label{sec:orgff243e0}
\label{sec:macros-citations}

\texttt{\textbackslash{}insertCite\{key\}\{package\}} cites the key and records it for use by
\texttt{\textbackslash{}insertAllCited\{\}}, see below. The style of the citations is author-year. 
The ''et al'' convention is used when there are  more than two authors\footnote{This feature was introduced in Rdpack 0.8-2.}. 

\code{key} can contain more keys separated by commas.
Here are some examples (on the left is
the code in the documentation chunk, on the right the rendered citation):

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Documentation source & rendered\\
\hline
\texttt{\textbackslash{}insertCite\{parseRd\}\{Rdpack\}} & (Murdoch 2010)\\
\texttt{\textbackslash{}insertCite\{Rpack:bibtex\}\{Rdpack\}} & (Francois 2014)\\
\texttt{\textbackslash{}insertCite\{parseRd,Rpack:bibtex\}\{Rdpack\}} & (Murdoch 2010; Francois 2014)\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

By default the citations are parenthesised \texttt{\textbackslash{}insertCite\{parseRd\}\{Rdpack\}} produces
\Sexpr{ insert_citeOnly("parseRd", "Rdpack") }, 
as in the examples above.  To get textual
citations, like 
\Sexpr{ insert_citeOnly("parseRd;textual", "Rdpack") }, 
put the string
\texttt{;textual} at the end of the key. Here are the examples from the table above, rendered
as textual citations:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Documentation source & \\
\hline
\texttt{\textbackslash{}insertCite\{parseRd;textual\}\{Rdpack\}} & Murdoch (2010)\\
\texttt{\textbackslash{}insertCite\{Rpack:bibtex;textual\}\{Rdpack\}} & Francois (2014)\\
\texttt{\textbackslash{}insertCite\{parseRd,Rpack:bibtex;textual\}\{Rdpack\}} & Murdoch (2010); Francois (2014)\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The last line in the table demonstrates that this also works with several citations.

The macro \texttt{\textbackslash{}insertNoCite\{key\}\{package\}} records one or more references for
\texttt{\textbackslash{}insertAllCited} but does not cite it. Setting \texttt{key} to \texttt{*} will record all
references from the specified package. For example, \texttt{\textbackslash{}insertNoCite\{R\}\{bibtex\}} records
the reference whose key is \texttt{R}, while \texttt{\textbackslash{}insertNoCite\{*\}\{utils\}} records all
references from package ``utils'' for inclusion by \texttt{\textbackslash{}insertAllCited}.

To mix the citations with other text, such as ``see also'' and ``chapter 3'', write the list
of keys as a free text, starting it with the symbol \texttt{@} and prefixing each key with it.
The \texttt{@} symbol will not appear in the output. For example, the following code:
\begin{verbatim}
  \insertCite{@see also @parseRd and @Rpack:bibtex}{Rdpack}
  \insertCite{@see also @parseRd; @Rpack:bibtex}{Rdpack}
  \insertCite{@see also @parseRd and @Rpack:bibtex;textual}{Rdpack}
\end{verbatim}
produces:

\qquad
\begin{tabular}{l}
\Sexpr{insert_citeOnly("@see also @parseRd and @Rpack:bibtex", "Rdpack")}\\
\Sexpr{insert_citeOnly("@see also @parseRd; @Rpack:bibtex", "Rdpack")}\\
\Sexpr{insert_citeOnly("@see also @parseRd and @Rpack:bibtex;textual", "Rdpack")}\\
\end{tabular}


\texttt{\textbackslash{}insertCiteOnly\{key\}\{package\}} is as \texttt{\textbackslash{}insertCite} but does not record the key 
for the list of references assembled by \texttt{\textbackslash{}insertAllCited}.

\subsection{Automatically generating lists of references}
\label{sec:org2098c9b}

The macro \texttt{\textbackslash{}insertAllCited\{\}} can be used to insert all references cited with
\texttt{\textbackslash{}insertCite} or \texttt{\textbackslash{}insertNoCite}. A natural place to put this macro is the
references section.  The Rd section may look something like:
\begin{verbatim}
    \references{
        \insertAllCited{}
    }
\end{verbatim}
The analogous documentation chunk in roxygen2 might look like this:
\begin{verbatim}
    #' @references
    #'     \insertAllCited{}
\end{verbatim}



\section{Possible issues}
\label{sec:orgc23fd8d}

\subsection{Warning from 'R CMD build'}
\label{sec:org23ed409}

If 'R CMD build' or \texttt{devtools::build()} gives a warning along the lines of:
\begin{verbatim}
    Warning: C:/temp/RtmpqWQqji/.../XXX.Rd:52: unknown macro '\insertRef'
\end{verbatim}
then check the syntax in file DESCRIPTION --- the most common cause of this is misspelling
\texttt{RdMacros:}.  Make sure in particular that `M' is uppercase.


\subsection{Development using `devtools'}
\label{sec:org07ff283}

The described procedure works transparently in `roxygen2' chunks and with Hadley Wickham's
`devtools'.  Packages are built and installed properly with the `devtools' commands and the
references are processed as expected.

Currently (2017-08-04) if you run help commands \texttt{?xxx} for functions from the package
you are working on and their help pages contain references, you may encounter some puzzling
warning messages in `developer' mode, something like:
\begin{verbatim}
    1: In tools::parse_Rd(path) :
      ~/mypackage/man/abcde.Rd: 67: unknown macro '\insertRef'
\end{verbatim}
These warnings are again about unknown macros but the reason is completely different:
they pop up because ``devtools'' reroutes the
help command to process the developer's Rd sources
(rather than the documentation in the
installed directory) but doesn't tell \texttt{parse\_Rd} where to look for additional macros\footnote{The claims in this sentence can be deduced entirely from the informative
message. Indeed, (1)\textasciitilde{}the error is in processing a source Rd file in the
development directory of the package, and (2)\textasciitilde{}the call to
\texttt{\textbackslash{}parse\_Rd} specifies only the file.}.

These warnings are harmless - the help pages are built properly and no warnings appear
outside ``developer'' mode, e.g. in a separate R\textasciitilde{}session. You may also consider using the
function \texttt{viewRd()}, discussed below, for viewing Rd files.


\subsection{Latex markup in BibTeX entries}
\label{sec:org6b16cbc}

In principle, BibTeX entries may contain arbitrary Latex markup, while the Rd format
supports only a subset. As a consequence, some BibTeX entries may need some editing when
included in REFERENCES.bib\footnote{Thanks to Michael Dewey for suggesting the discussion of this.\label{org50e22be}}. Only do this for entries that do not render properly or
cause errors, since most of the time this should not be necessary.

If mathematics doesn't render properly replace the Latex dollar syntax with Rd's \texttt{\textbackslash{}eqn},
e.g. \texttt{\$x\textasciicircum{}2\$} with \texttt{\textbackslash{}eqn\{x\textasciicircum{}2\}}. This should not be needed for versions of Rdpack
0.8-4 or later. 

Some Latex macros may have to be removed or replaced with suitable Rd markup. Again,
do this only if they cause problems, since some are supported, e.g. \texttt{\textbackslash{}doi}.

See also the overview help page, \code{help("Rdpack-package")}, of \pkg{Rdpack}. 
Among other things, it contains some dummy references which illustrate the above.


\subsection{Viewing Rd files}
\label{sec:orge2b9228}


A function, \code{viewRd}, to view Rd files in the source directory of a package was
introduced in version 0.4-23 of \pkg{Rdpack}. A typical user call would look something like:
\begin{verbatim}
    Rdpack::viewRd("./man/filename.Rd")
\end{verbatim}
By default the requested help page is shown in text format. To open the page in a browser,
set argument \code{type} to \code{"html"}:
\begin{verbatim}
    Rdpack::viewRd("./man/filename.Rd", type = "html")
\end{verbatim}

Users of 'devtools' can use \code{viewRd()} in place of \code{help()} to view Rd sources\textsuperscript{\ref{org50e22be}}.
