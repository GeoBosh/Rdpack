Changes in Version 0.5-0

   - moved gbRd from Depends to Imports and adjusted some examples to use
     tools::parse_Rd() rather than parse_Rd() (before this was not necessary
     since 'gbRd' Depends on 'tools').


Changes in Version 0.4-23

   - new function viewRd() parses and shows an Rd file in a source package.
     May be particularly helpful for devtools developers.

   - revamped the vignette, added additional explanations of possible issues.

   - new functions makeVignetteReference() and vigbib() generate Bibtex
     references for vignettes in a package.

Changes in Version 0.4-22

   - Added the requirement to Import Rdpack to the help page of insert_ref().
     (It was out of sync with the vignette.)

   - Updated Description in DESCRIPTION, which was also out of sync with the
     vignette.

   - Bug fix in the vignette: changed \@references to @references in the
     roxygen2 example.


Changes in Version 0.4-21

   - Edited and amended vignette "Inserting_bibtex_references", including:
       - additional explanation and an example,
       - requirement to import Rdpack and a mention of travis etc.
       - paragraph about devtools.

   - changed the URL for parse_Rd.pdf in REFERENCES.bib to https.


Changes in Version 0.4-20 (CRAN)

   - cleaned up some minor CRAN issues.


Changes in Version 0.4-19

   - new facility for inserting references from BibTeX files - just put the line:

        RdMacros: Rdpack

    in the DESCRIPTION file of your package and the references in inst/REFERENCES.bib.
    Then put \inserRef{key}{yourpackage} in documentation chunks to insert item
    'key' from the bib file. This works with both manually created Rd files and
    roxygen comments, see the documentation for details.


Changes in Version 0.4-18 (CRAN)

   - from now on, put (CRAN) next to versions published on CRAN (as above)

   - a minor correction in file NE


Changes in Version 0.4-17

   - In file DESCRIPTION, changed reprompt and rebib to reprompt() and rebib().


Changes in Version 0.4-16

   - don't export parse_text

   - corrected bug in reprompt for S4 classes - new slots were not handled correctly (see
     slots.R for details).

   - reprompt for S4 methods - if the methods documentation describes methods that do not
     exist, print an informative message for the user. (Such methods are also printed for
     debugging purposes but in non-user friendly form.)

   - included 'methods' in imports - around R-devel (2015-07-01 r68620) not including it
     triggers warnings)


Changes in Version 0.4-8
   - new  functions .whichtageq and .whichtagin; replaced most calls to toolsdotdotdotRdTags
     with these.

   - removed toolsdotdotdotRdTags

Changes in Version 0.4-7
   - removed ::: calls from code; copied some functions from `tools' to achieve this
     (see threedots.R). Renamed the functions replacing  ::: with dotdotdot.

   - export by name (not the generic export pattern); preparation for more selective export
     of functions in the future.

   - new functions: Rdo_get_argument_names, Rdo_get_item_labels

Changes in Version 0.4-5
   - dependence bibtex becomes "Imports".
     tools and gbRd remain (for now) "Depends" since functions from them are used in some
     examples without "require"'s.

   - rebib: now outfile="" can be used to request overwriting infile.
           (a small convenience; before the change, one could do this by
           giving the outfile and infile the same values.)

   - Bug fix: predefined.Rd contained \tabular environments with vertical bars, '|', in the
     format specification. This is not documented in "Writing R exts" but works for LaTeX and
     remained unnoticed by me and R CMD check. However, rendering the help page for the
     objects documented in predefined.Rd gave an error in html and text mode.
     Package installation failed only if html was requested at build time.

   - small changes in the documentation

Changes in Version 0.4-1
   - new major feature: processing references from Bibtex files.
     The top user level function is rebib(),  which updates
     section "references" in an Rd file. promptPackageSexpr() has
     been updated to use this feature. inspect_Rdbib() can be used
     in programming.

   - new auxiliary functions for work with bibentry objects.

   - new convenience programming functions for Rd objects.

   - some small bug fixes.

   - some gaps in the documentation filled.


Changes in Version 0.3-11

   - reprompt() did not handle properly S4 replacement methods. Changed the parsing of the
     arguments to rectify this. Some other functions also needed correction to handle this.

Changes in Version 0.3-10

   - Depends field in DESCRIPTION file updated to require R 2.15.0 or later.
     (because of a few uses of paste0() in recent code.)

Changes in Version 0.3-8

   - first public version
