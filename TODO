* (2024-11-09) do something with 'RdpackTester' (under inst/examples).
  I had forgotten about it but could add examples about issues and their fixing.
  Also, indicate somewhere to users how to use it to report bugs.
  Alternatively, make a repo where they can contribute.

* vignette for reprompt/ereprompt/RStudio_reprompt

* pcDst.Rd gives an error, it was produced by Roxygen.

* escape percents in strings in usage sections, e.g. usage for f(dateformat = "%Y-%m-%d"),
  see also a related question on R-devel

* reprompt("xxx-methods",...) to set the "doctype" field to "methods"
