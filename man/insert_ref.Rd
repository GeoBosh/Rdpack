\title{Insert bibtex references in Rd and roxygen2 documentation}
\description{

  Package Rdpack provides an Rd macro for inserting references from
  bibtex files into R documentation.  Function insert_ref() is the
  workhorse behind this mechanism. The description given in this page
  should be sufficient, for more details see the vignette.

}
\usage{
insert_ref(key, package = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{key}{the bibtex key of the reference, a character string.}
  \item{package}{the package in which to look for the the bibtex file.}
  \item{\dots}{further arguments to pass on to \code{bibtex::read.bib}}
}
\details{
  \code{insert_ref} extracts a reference from a bibtex file, converts
  it to Rd format and returns a single string with embedded newline
  characters. It is the workhorse in the provided mechanism but most
  users do not even need to know about \code{insert_ref}.

  The documentation of a package using the mechanism provided here
  relies on the Rd macro \verb{\\insertRef} and needs to be prepared as
  follows: 
  % To prepare a package to use this mechanism, the following preparation
  % steps need to be done:
  \enumerate{
    \item{
      File `DESCRIPTION' should contain the following line: \cr

      \verb{RdMacros: Rdpack} \cr
      
      (If there is already a line starting with 'RdMacros:', Rdpack
      should be added to the list on that line.)
    }

    \item{
      `Rdpack' should be added to the list of imports in file
      `DESCRIPTION'. 
    }
    
    \item{
      The BibTeX references should be put in file
      \code{"REFERENCES.bib"} in subdirectory \code{"inst/"} of the 
      package.
    }

  }
  
  References are inserted in documentation using the syntax
  \verb{\\insertRef{key}{package}}, where \verb{key} is the bibtex key
  of the reference and \verb{package} is an R package containing file
  \code{"REFERENCES.bib"} from which the reference should be taken.

  This works in manually written Rd files and in `roxygen2' documentation
  chunks. The references will appear in the place where the macro is put,
  usually in a dedicated references section (\verb{\\references}
  in Rd files, \verb{@references} in roxygen chunks).

  Argument 'package' can be any installed R package, not necessarily the
  one of the documentation object.  This works for
  packages that have \code{"REFERENCES.bib"} in their installation
  directory and for the default packages.
  
  For example, the references in the references section of this help
  page are generated by the following lines in the Rd file:
  \preformatted{
    \\insertRef{Rpack:bibtex}{Rdpack}

    \\insertRef{R}{bibtex}
  }

  A roxygen2 documentation chunk might look like this:
  \preformatted{
    #' @references
    #' \\insertRef{Rpack:bibtex}{Rdpack}
    #'
    #' \\insertRef{R}{bibtex}
  }

  The first reference has label \verb{Rpack:bibtex} and is taken from
  file \code{"REFERENCES.bib"} in package `Rdpack'. The second reference
  is from the file with the same name in package \verb{"bibtex"}.
  
  For more details see vignette:
  \code{vignette("Inserting_bibtex_references", package = "Rdpack")}


  The references are processed when the package is built.

  From version 0.6-1 of \pkg{Rdpack}, additional Rd macros are
  available for citations.  They can be used in Rd and
  roxygen2 documentation.

  \code{\\insertCite{key}{package}} cites the key and records it for
  use by \code{\\insertAllCited}, see below. \code{key} can contain
  more keys separated by commas.

  \tabular{ll}{
     \code{\\insertCite{parseRd,Rpack:bibtex}{Rdpack}} \tab \insertCite{parseRd,Rpack:bibtex}{Rdpack}     \cr
     \code{\\insertCite{Rpack:bibtex}{Rdpack}}   \tab \insertCite{Rpack:bibtex}{Rdpack} 
  }

  By default the citations are parenthesised
  \insertCite{parseRd}{Rdpack}.  To get textual citations, like
  \insertCite{parseRd;textual}{Rdpack}, put the string \code{;textual}
  at the end of the key. The references in the last two sentences were
  produced with \code{\\insertCite{parseRd}{Rdpack}} and
  \code{\\insertCite{parseRd;textual}{Rdpack}}, respectively.
  This also works with several citations, e.g.
  \cr
    \code{\\insertCite{parseRd,Rpack:bibtex;textual}{Rdpack}}
  produces: \insertCite{parseRd,Rpack:bibtex;textual}{Rdpack}.

  The macro \code{\\insertNoCite{key}{package}} records one or more
  references for \code{\\insertAllCited} but does not cite it. Setting
  \code{key} to \code{*} will include all references from the
  specified package. For example, 
  \code{\\insertNoCite{R}{bibtex}}  and  \code{\\insertNoCite{*}{utils}}
  record the specified references for inclusion by \code{\\insertAllCited}. 

  \code{\\insertAllCited} inserts all references cited with
  \code{\\insertCite} or \code{\\insertNoCite}. Putting this macro
  in the references section will keep it up to date automatically. 
  The Rd section may look something like:
  \preformatted{
    \\insertAllCited
  }
  or in roxygen2, the references chunk might look like this:
  \preformatted{
    #' @references
    #'     \\insertAllCited
  }

To mix the citations with other text, such as \sQuote{see also} and
\sQuote{chapter 3}, write the list of keys as a free text, starting
it with the symbol \code{@} and prefixing each key with it. 
The \code{@} symbol will not appear in the output. For example, the following code
\preformatted{
  \insertCite{@see also @parseRd and @Rpack:bibtex}{Rdpack}

  \insertCite{@see also @parseRd; @Rpack:bibtex}{Rdpack}

  \insertCite{@see also @parseRd and @Rpack:bibtex;textual}{Rdpack}
}
produces:

\tabular{l}{
  \insertCiteOnly{@see also @parseRd and @Rpack:bibtex}{Rdpack} \cr
  \insertCiteOnly{@see also @parseRd; @Rpack:bibtex}{Rdpack} \cr
  \insertCiteOnly{@see also @parseRd and @Rpack:bibtex;textual}{Rdpack}
}

\code{\\insertCiteOnly{key}{package}} is as
\code{\\insertCite} but does not include the key in the list of
references for \code{\\insertAllCited}.




% Provision to add prefixes and suffixes is also envisaged but is currently under testing and  not documented.
